* Attach documents or link to reports and platform pages
* Interact with other users through comments and mentions
* Track the progress of assigned or shared tasks
* Create new tasks quickly and intuitively

```

The Task Board is not just an organizational view; it is an active workspace where you can:

* Modify, comment, or update tasks directly

At the heart of this experience is the **Task Board**, a dedicated platform section where all tasks are displayed in a **column board** format, sorted by status (e.g., _New_, _To Do_, _In Progress_, _Completed_). This visual representation allows users to quickly understand task status, see priorities, and make direct interventions with changes or updates.

The platform offers an advanced task management system, designed to improve work organization, team collaboration, and action traceability. Every task can be created, assigned, monitored, and completed directly within the digital workspace. Task transitions are free, with no predefined constraints.

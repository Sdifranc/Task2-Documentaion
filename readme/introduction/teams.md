# Teams

## Overview

**Team Management** is a key feature of the platform, designed to support collaborative work, effective task assignment, and the organization of responsibilities within organizations.\
This guide explains how teams work, how they are managed, and how they interact with task management.

**Teams** are groups of users defined within a specific organization. They are designed to reflect the actual structure of operational units (e.g., departments, project groups, production lines).\
**Multiple teams** can be created for each organization _(DACXX-934)._\
**Teams can only be managed** if the **“Task”** feature is enabled for the organization.

### Team View for Administrators

To manage Teams, the user must have a User Scope of at least **Organization Administration**. Once this level of access is granted, the user can navigate to the **"Users"** section where — within the **"Organization"** group — it will be possible to **create one or more teams for each available organization**.

**User Admins**  are authorized to create teams, but only within the organization to which they belong. This ensures that the creation and management of teams remain aligned with the administrator's scope of responsibility and visibility.

The view is strictly limited to teams belonging to the administrator’s organization, ensuring consistent and controlled management of internal structures in line with assigned responsibilities.

In the navigation panel, teams are grouped by organization and appear as sub-items under the corresponding organization’s name. Teams that are not associated with any organization are listed separately under **“Users without organization”**, allowing administrators to keep track of incomplete or temporary configurations.

Next to each team, the **number of assigned users** is displayed, enabling a quick assessment of the group’s size. Within the **user support panel**, the teams the user belongs to are shown **grouped by organization**, providing a clear contextual view of each user’s associations.
